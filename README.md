If the same player is the higher-rated for two rounds in a row, they are replaced. Witty comments add fun to the game based on your score!

## 🚀 What I Learned

In this project, I learned about web scraping after struggling to find an API for player data. I used Claude AI to help me write a web scraper for the website [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.co.in/). The scraper collected data for around 200 Premier League players, which was then parsed into a JSON format.

The web scraper code is located in the `api` folder (to be run in the console), and the resulting JSON with player data is stored in the `src/assets` folder. This process helped me dive into web scraping and gave me hands-on experience in extracting and working with real-world data. It also improved my ability to handle and organize data efficiently.
